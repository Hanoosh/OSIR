		<h1>OSIR</h1>
		
		OSIR, Open Source Infectious Ransomware, is an open source class
		project by <a href="https://github.com/Irie88">Sarah
		Brickner</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Property404">Dagan
		Martinez</a> at Florida Polytechnic University.
		
		<p>The goal of the project is to create a cross-platform self
		replicating malware that looks for desired files and encrypts
		them with an RSA encrypted AES key, holding them ransom until
		the desired amount (default 0 BTC) is payed.

		<p><br><br><strong>Prototypes</strong>
		<br><a href="http://daganmartinez.com/prototypes/OSIR_prototype_0_ransomware.zip">
		OSIR_prototype_0_ransomware</a><br>Scrapped ransomware prototype
		programmed in Python. This is a very small, quickly written
		prototype that uses RSA and a Blowfish cipher to encrypt the
		__pycache__ directory and redirect the host owner to a
		site(localhost) that gives them the decryption key.
		
		<br><br><a href="http://daganmartinez.com/prototypes/OSIR_prototype_0_replicator.zip">
		OSIR_prototype_0_replicator</a><br>Scrapped replicator
		prototype programmed in C++. This is a very large prototype that
		includes an entire compiler binary in the source code. It works
		by writing C code that includes a target file as well as a
		malicious file, and compiling that code. Being about 1 MB, this
		is a very bulky prototype.
		
		<br><br><a href="http://daganmartinez.com/prototypes/OSIR_prototype_1_replicator.zip">
		OSIR_prototype_1_replicator</a><br>Replicator prototype forked
		from main branch, programmed in C. This is very light compared
		to prototype 0 replicator, being about 10 KB when compiled with
		the Tiny C Compiler, or a little over 1% of the previous
		prototype's size.
