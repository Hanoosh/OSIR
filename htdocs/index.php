		OSIR, Open Source Infectious Ransomware, is an open source class
		project by <a href="https://github.com/Irie88">Sarah
		Brickner</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Property404">Dagan
		Martinez</a> at Florida Polytechnic University.
		
		<p>The goal of the project is to create a cross-platform self
		replicating malware that looks for desired files and encrypts
		them with an RSA encrypted AES key, holding them ransom until
		the desired amount (default 0 BTC) is payed.
